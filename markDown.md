# Hello Dr. Jan thank you for helping learn markdown.
## In the SSDT we use Markdown all the time in PR's but I have never been formally introduced to it.
### MarkDown is a good way to organize all the content in a Pull Request I espcially use the ticks to highlight lines of `code` and `file names`
Some new things I have learned are how to **Bold** text, ~~Strike Through~~ text, and ...
> Quote sections.
